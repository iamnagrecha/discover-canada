A TRADING NATION
Canada has always been a trading nation and commerce 
remains the engine of economic growth. As Canadians, we 
could not maintain our standard of living without engaging in 
trade with other nations.

In 1988, Canada enacted free trade with the United States. 
Mexico became a partner in 1994 in the broader North 
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), with over 444 
million people and over $1 trillion in merchandise trade in 2008.

Today, Canada has one of the ten largest economies in the 
world and is part of the G8 group of leading industrialized 
countries with the United States, Germany, the United 
Kingdom, Italy, France, Japan and Russia
