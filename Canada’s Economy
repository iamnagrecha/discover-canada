A TRADING NATION
Canada has always been a trading nation and commerce 
remains the engine of economic growth. As Canadians, we 
could not maintain our standard of living without engaging in 
trade with other nations.

In 1988, Canada enacted free trade with the United States. 
Mexico became a partner in 1994 in the broader North 
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), with over 444 
million people and over $1 trillion in merchandise trade in 2008.

Today, Canada has one of the ten largest economies in the 
world and is part of the G8 group of leading industrialized 
countries with the United States, Germany, the United 
Kingdom, Italy, France, Japan and Russia.

CANADA’S ECONOMY INCLUDES THREE MAIN TYPES OF 
INDUSTRIES:

1)  Service industries- More than 75% of working Canadians now have jobs in service industries
2)  Manufacturing industries- Our largest international trading partner is the United States.
3)  Natural resources industries -. Today, the economy of many areas of the 
country still depends on developing natural resources, and 
a large percentage of Canada’s exports are natural 
resources commodities.

 Millions of Canadians and Americans cross every 
year and in safety what is traditionally known as “the world’s 
longest undefended border
