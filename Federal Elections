Under legislation passed by Parliament, federal elections must 
be held on the third Monday in October every four years 
following the most recent general election.

Canada is divided into 308 electoral districts, also known as 
ridings or constituencies

Canadian citizens who are 18 years old or older may run in a 
federal election

AFTER AN ELECTION
Ordinarily, after an election, the leader of the political party with 
the most seats in the House of Commons is invited by the 
Governor General to form the governmen.

 If the party in power holds at least 
half of the seats in the House of Commons, this is called a 
majority government. If the party in power holds less than half 
of the seats in the House of Commons, this is called a minority 
government.

Provincial, territorial and municipal elections are held by secret 
ballot, but the rules are not the same as those for federal 
elections. It is important to find out the rules for voting in 
provincial, territorial and local elections so that you can 
exercise your right to vote.
