our country is a federal state, 
a parliamentary democracy and a 
constitutional monarchy.

There are federal, provincial, territorial and municipal 
governments in Canada.

In Canadaâ€™s parliamentary democracy, the people elect 
members to the House of Commons in Ottawa and to the 
provincial and territorial legislatures.

Parliament has three parts: the Sovereign (Queen or King), 
the Senate and the House of Commons. Provincial 
legislatures comprise the Lieutenant Governor and the elected 
Assembly.

In the federal government, the Prime Minister selects the 
Cabinet ministers and is responsible for the operations and 
policy of the government. The House of Commons is the 
representative chamber, made up of members of Parliament 
elected by the people, traditionally every four years. Senators
are appointed by the Governor General on the advice of the 
Prime Minister and serve until age 75
