Toronto’s business district: Canada’s financial capita

The Cold War began when several liberated countries of 
eastern Europe became part of a Communist bloc controlled by 
the Soviet Union under the dictator Josef Stalin. Canada joined 
with other democratic countries of the West to form the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), a military alliance, and 
with the United States in the North American Aerospace 
Defence Command (NORAD).

In 1970, Canada helped found La Francophonie, an 
international association of French-speaking countries.
