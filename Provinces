THE ATLANTIC PROVINCES
Atlantic Canada’s coasts and natural resources, including 
fishing, farming, forestry and mining, have made these 
provinces an important part of Canada’s history and 
developmen

Newfoundland and Labrador
Newfoundland and Labrador is the most easterly point in North 
America and has its own time zone. In addition to its natural 
beauty, the province has a unique heritage linked to the sea. 
The oldest colony of the British Empire and a strategic prize in 
Canada’s early history, the province has long been known for 
its fisheries, coastal fishing villages and distinct culture. Today 
off-shore oil and gas extraction contributes a substantial part of 
the economy. Labrador also has immense hydro-electric 
resources.

Prince Edward Island
Prince Edward Island (P.E.I.) is the smallest province, known 
for its beaches, red soil and agriculture, especially potatoes. 
P.E.I. is the birthplace of Confederation, connected to mainland 
Canada by one of the longest continuous multispan bridges in 
the world, the Confederation Bridge.

Nova Scotia
Nova Scotia is the most populous Atlantic Province, with a rich 
history as the gateway to Canada. Known for the world’s 
highest tides in the Bay of Fundy, the province’s identity is 
linked to shipbuilding, fisheries and shipping.
