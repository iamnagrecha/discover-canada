When Germany attacked Belgium and France in 1914 and 
Britain declared war, Ottawa formed the Canadian 
Expeditionary Force (later the Canadian Corps). More than 
600,000 Canadians served in the war, most of them volunteers, 
out of a total population of eight million.

 The Canadian Corps captured Vimy 
Ridge in April 1917, with 10,000 killed or wounded, securing 
the Canadians’ reputation for valour as the “shock troops of the 
British Empire.” One Canadian officer said: “It was Canada 
from the Atlantic to the Pacific on parade … In those few 
minutes I witnessed the birth of a nation.” April 9 is celebrated 
as Vimy Day.
