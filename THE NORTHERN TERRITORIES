The Northwest Territories, Nunavut and Yukon contain onethird of Canada’s land mass but have a population of only 
100,000. There are gold, lead, copper, diamond and zinc 
mines. Oil and gas deposits are being developed. The North is 
often referred to as the “Land of the Midnight Sun” because at 
the height of summer, daylight can last up to 24 hours.

Yukon
Thousands of miners came to the Yukon during the Gold Rush 
of the 1890s, as celebrated in the poetry of Robert W. Service. 
Mining remains a significant part of the economy. The White 
Pass and Yukon Railway opened from Skagway in 
neighbouring Alaska to the territorial capital, Whitehorse in 
1900 and provides a spectacular tourist excursion across 
precipitous passes and bridges. Yukon holds the record for the 
coldest temperature ever recorded in Canada (-63°C).
