The Northwest Territories, Nunavut and Yukon contain onethird of Canada’s land mass but have a population of only 
100,000. There are gold, lead, copper, diamond and zinc 
mines. Oil and gas deposits are being developed. The North is 
often referred to as the “Land of the Midnight Sun” because at 
the height of summer, daylight can last up to 24 hours.

Yukon
Thousands of miners came to the Yukon during the Gold Rush 
of the 1890s, as celebrated in the poetry of Robert W. Service. 
Mining remains a significant part of the economy. The White 
Pass and Yukon Railway opened from Skagway in 
neighbouring Alaska to the territorial capital, Whitehorse in 
1900 and provides a spectacular tourist excursion across 
precipitous passes and bridges. Yukon holds the record for the 
coldest temperature ever recorded in Canada (-63°C).

Northwest Territories
The Northwest Territories (N.W.T.) were originally made up in 
1870 from Rupert’s Land and the North-Western Territory. The 
capital, Yellowknife (population 20,000), is called the “diamond 
capital of North America.

Nunavut
Nunavut, meaning “our land” in Inuktitut, was established in 
1999 from the eastern part of the Northwest Territories, 
including all of the former District of Keewatin. The capital is 
Iqaluit, formerly Frobisher Bay, named after the English 
explorer Martin Frobisher, who penetrated the uncharted Arctic 
for Queen Elizabeth I in 1576.

The Canadian Rangers
Canada’s vast north brings security and sovereignty 
challenges. Dealing with harsh weather conditions in an 
isolated region, the Canadian Rangers, part of the Canadian 
Forces Reserves (militia), play a key role
