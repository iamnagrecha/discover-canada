Canada is governed by an organized system of laws. These 
laws are the written rules intended to guide people in our 
society. They are made by elected representatives. The courts 
settle disputes and the police enforce the laws. The law in 
Canada applies to everyone, including judges, politicians and 
the police. 


The Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police (RCMP) enforce federal laws throughout 
Canada, and serve as the provincial police in all provinces and 
territories except Ontario and Quebec, as well as in some 
municipalities.

THE FLEUR-DE-LYS
It is said that the lily flower (“fleur-de-lys”) was adopted by the 
French king in the year 496. It became the symbol of French 
royalty for more than 1,000 years, including the colony of New 
France. Revived at Confederation, the fleur-de-lys was 
included in the Canadian Red Ensign. In 1948 Quebec adopted 
its own flag, based on the Cross and the fleur-de-lys.

Parliament passed the Official Languages Act in 1969.
