The Oath of Citizenship
I swear (or affirm)
That I will be faithful
And bear true allegiance
To Her Majesty
Queen Elizabeth the Second
Queen of Canada
Her Heirs and Successors
And that I will faithfully observe
The laws of Canada
Including the Constitution
Which recognizes and affirms
The Aboriginal and treaty rights of
First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples
And fulfil my duties
As a Canadian citizen.


Together, these secure for Canadians an 800-year old tradition 
of ordered liberty, which dates back to the signing of Magna 
Carta in 1215 in England (also known as the Great Charter of
Freedoms), including:

Habeas corpus, the right to challenge unlawful detention by 
the state, comes from English common law
